*** ANSWERS:
---  Please provide answers to each question as specified. Other
---  text will be ignored. Please only uncomment the line containing
---  your answers and do not change any other text. Each question
---  should have exactly ONE answer. Any questions with more than
---  one answer uncommented will receive ZERO marks. For each question
---  your answers should reflect your knowledge of the learning algorithms
---  applied, and the results obtained on the datasets used.

--------------------------------------------------------------
*** QUESTION 1
--- For this question "results" means the results you saved in "q1.out".

*** Question 1(a) [1 mark]

--- Looking at the results for BOTH the Nearest Neighbour and
--- Decision Tree learning algorithms over all the datasets, I
--- observed the following regarding a possible "learning curve"
--- effect due to increasing the size of the training set:

--- (1) on some datasets error is reduced, i.e., some show a learning curve
 (2) on most datasets error is reduced, i.e., most show a learning curve
--- (3) on all datasets error is reduced, i.e., all show a learning curve
--- (4) error was basically unchanged, i.e., no learning curve
--- (5) Decision Trees are better than Nearest Neighbour learning algorithms 

*** Question 1(b) [4 marks]
--- First, insert your error reduction numbers in the table below (refer to
--- the assignment notebook for details on how to calculate these).
--- In particular, in each of the 4 cells in the table, substitute
--- the respective numbers you calculated for the phrase "My number".
--- PLEASE ENSURE YOU DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER PART OF THE TABLE ! 
--- The completed table is worth 2 marks.

********************************************************************************
***                 Mean error reduction relative to default
********************************************************************************
*** Algorithm            After 10% training	After 100% training
********************************************************************************
*** Nearest Neighbour      23.60              47.77      
*** Decision Tree          39.19              69.69      
********************************************************************************

--- The rest of this question has two multiple-choice parts, each worth 1 mark.

*** Part 1:
--- Comparing the Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree learning
--- algorithms based on your numbers on mean error reduction
--- relative to default on only 10% of the data I observe that:

 (1) 10% of the data is not enough for learning a good model
--- (2) only the Decision Tree learner reduces error with 10% of the data
--- (3) only the Nearest Neighbour learner reduces error with 10% of the data
--- (4) both algorithms learn models that reduce error by more than 20% with 10% of the data

*** Part 2:
--- From my knowledge of how the Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree
--- learning algorithms work I suggest the following explanation for
--- the results in the table:

--- (1) Decision Trees cannot reduce error enough
--- (2) Nearest Neighbour cannot reduce error enough
--- (3) Nearest Neighbour may be overfitting some of the datasets 
 (4) Decision Trees may be overfitting some of the datasets
--- (5) Deep Learning will definitely do better with less data

--------------------------------------------------------------
*** QUESTION 2 [2 marks]
--- For this question "results" means the results you saved in "q2.out".
--- This question has two multiple-choice parts, each worth 1 mark.

*** Part 1:
--- From your knowledge of how text data is represented in machine
--- learning as a "bag-of-words", and referring to the
--- CountVectorizer pre-processing method in the sklearn
--- documentation, answer the following question about how we have
--- used it to transform the original text data. For this text
--- classification problem, CountVectorizer pre-processing was
--- applied to the snippet data to:

--- (1) generate the vocabulary and count the frequency of words independently for the training and test sets
--- (2) generate the vocabulary and count the frequency of words overall for the combined training and test sets
 (3) generate the vocabulary overall for the combined training and test sets, and count the frequency of words independently for the training and test sets
--- (4) generate the vocabulary independently for the training and test sets, and count the frequency of words overall for the combined training and test sets

*** Part 2:
--- Given the large numbers of words and tokens that apear in
--- typical natural language data, text classification learning
--- problems are usually very high-dimensional. Feature selection is
--- designed to improve the classification performance of machine
--- learning algorithms by reducing the number of irrelevant
--- features that could be included in a predictive model.  From
--- your results, select an explanation for the effect of feature
--- selection on the performance of Multinomial Naive Bayes on the
--- snippet classification dataset:

--- (1) Multinomial Naive Bayes is rarely used for text classification
(2) the class-conditional probabilities for most of the words are relevant to classification 
--- (3) text classification is not possible using just the class-conditional probabilities of the words
--- (4) the prior probabilities of the class labels will dominate the the class-conditional probabilities of the words
