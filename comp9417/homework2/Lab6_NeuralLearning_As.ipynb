    "We got right down to the details of how a linear classifier works. Now this being a perceptron, you probably recall that rather than using a fixed set of weights to do the prediction each time, there is a simple training rule that updates the weights on the basis of discrepancies between the classifier's prediction on the data and the actual class. So we could extend our previous code to implement that training rule, but the code is a little fiddly and you're probably thinking there should be a simpler way to do this. If so, you are correct, but it is based on moving towards coding with matrix and vector operations, rather than directly using Python arrays. To do this we need to import the NumPy library (there is a tutorial at: <href <a>https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html</a>>)."

Perhaps surprisingly this simple algorithm actually learns to classify, but unfortunately, this basic implementation of neural learning is not likely to find a very good model. It's also not clear if it converges. You might want to increase the number of iterations from 20. Also, you could try transforming the data, for example, by making all attribute values lie in the same range. Search for methods of normalisation using the NumPy built-in functions \"np.mean()\" and \"np.var()\". For example, you could transform dataset ```X``` with this normalisation:\n",
    "```Z = (X - np.mean(X,axis = 0))/(np.var(X,axis = 0)**0.5)```."
